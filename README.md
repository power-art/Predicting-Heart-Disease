# Predicting-Heart-Disease
In this machine learning project, I have collected the dataset from kaggle
(https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and I will be using Machine Learning to predict whether
any person is suffering from heart disease

There are some steps involved:-
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  
  The main goal in exploratory data analysis is to find more about the data and become a 
  subject matter export on the dataset you're working with
  
  1. What questions are you trying to solve?
  2. What kind of data do we have and how do we treat different types?
  3. What is missing from the data and how do you deal with it?
  4. Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
  5. How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?
